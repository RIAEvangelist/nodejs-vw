#### Vw redesign Benefits
VW has been redesigned to have certain characteristics that was not in the initial versions. Now you can install vw completely from NPM. Before it was installed by a script that was not complete.
vw vw now allows communication between processes, with the result that you can get the list of processes on vw, to restrict the execution of an application to a single instance, among others.
